Genetic
=======

Using genetic algorithms to create arbitrary crossover between digitally described artefacts.

Stage One: Bitmaps
------------------

Initial PoC is to create some BMP files to understand the problem domain and, by using distinctive patterns, achieve recognisable crossover.
Crossover and concomitant transcription errors are inspired both by biological genetic processes such as meiosis and computing and telecommunication 
processes such as bit errors, noise, crosstalk and so forth.
